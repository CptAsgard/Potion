# Potion
A bootstrapping project for real-time applications. Is meant as a base to avoid direct OpenGL. Potion has the following features.

- Stateless rendering architecture for minimalizing state changes
- Build process to integrate an 'Assets' folder into the build
- Support for render textures and image effects
- Support for switching materials and shaders intuitively
   - Automatically reassigns any assignments done to a material, such as textures, if the shader is changed

# How to Use
Currently, Potion is not ready for use in a project. However, the project is being actively developed. If the project comes to a usable state, I will describe how to use Potion in your projects.
